# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis 

A visual summary of Pyber's ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) was created and their performance was compared, which is the purpose of this analysis. In order to achieve the desired results, Python modules, such as Matplotlib and NumPy, are used to plot DataFrames.

## Results

The outline shows that there is a bigger interest for PyBer among riders in urban cities contrasted with rural and suburban cities. Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban areas, 625 rides in suburban areas, and 125 rides in rural areas.

On a comparative example, there was additionally a bigger volume of drivers in urban areas contrasted with rural and suburban cities. There were 2,405 drivers in urban areas, 490 drivers in suburban areas, and 78 drivers in rural cities.

Considering that there is a more noteworthy utilization of PyBer in urban cities, the total fares are subsequently additionally higher than rural and suburban cities. PyBer transactions in urban cities added up to almost $40,000 in comparison to transactions in suburban cities and rural cities added up to no less than $19,000 and $4,000 respectively.

As far as expenses, apparently riders in rural areas pay on avaerage nearly $10 more for PyBer than riders in urban areas. The average fare per ride is about $35 in rural areas in comparison to the average fare per ride is about $25 in urban areas. Suburban areas' average fare per ride falls only in the middle - at about $31. While it may not be uplifting news for riders in rural areas, it is a superior market for drivers in this sort of city. The average fare per driver is about $55 in rural cities, though the average fare per driver is about $17 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per driver is about $40.

The orange pattern shows how the total fares in suruban cities fall in the middle of rural and urban cities: around $700 to $1,300 from start to finish during this time. 

## Summary

There is a bigger utilization of PyBer ridesharing in urban cities. There are a larger number of drivers in urban cities than rural areas. Thus, most of PyBer's income happens in urban cities. Then again, the fares for involving PyBer is more prominent among riders in rural areas than urban cities. This could deter possible riders from utilizing PyBer given the high average fare per ride. Drivers in rural areas are acquiring more than drivers in urban cities. This could deter possible drivers from working with PyBer given the low average fare per driver.
